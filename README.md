Hello, its me "the developer" of this thing:

This Simple python Project is a part of my high school Exhibition (Grade-11 / 2024):

it is uses Python3 (3.12 to be exact) and two modules :
	      {PySimpleGUI , pygame 2.5.2}

This is largely a passion project, done for practice , completely by myself
	       (Which iam quite proud of):

Thx for checking my stuff out, developing this has been a fun experience:

:Also thanks to my friends and teachers for the support (Love you guys XD ):
